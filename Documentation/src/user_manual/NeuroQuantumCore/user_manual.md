# NeuroQuantumCore User Manual

## Introduction

NeuroQuantumCore is a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive way to work with quantum neural networks. This user manual will guide you through the process of installing, configuring, and using NeuroQuantumCore.

## Installation

To install NeuroQuantumCore, you can use pip:

```bash
1. pip install NeuroQuantumCore
```

# Configuration

Before you can use NeuroQuantumCore, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a configuration file called neuroquantumcore.cfg in the root directory of your project.

Here is an example configuration file:

```ini
1. [neuroquantumcore]
2. backend = qiskit
3. num_qubits = 2
```

This configuration file tells NeuroQuantumCore to use the Qiskit backend and to use 2 qubits.

# Using NeuroQuantumCore
To use NeuroQuantumCore, you need to import it in your Python script:

```python
1. from NeuroQuantumCore import NeuroQuantumCore
```

You can then create a NeuroQuantumCore object:

```python
1. neuro_quantum_core = NeuroQuantumCore()
```

You can use the train_model method to train a quantum neural network:

1. neuro_quantum_core.train_model()

You can use the predict method to make predictions with the trained model:

```python
1. prediction = neuro_quantum_core.predict()
```
Conclusion
NeuroQuantumCore is a powerful tool for working with quantum neural networks. With its simple and intuitive API, you can easily train and use quantum neural networks in your Python scripts.
