# QuantumEntanglementNetwork User Manual

## Introduction

QuantumEntanglementNetwork is a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive way to work with quantum entanglement networks. This user manual will guide you through the process of installing, configuring, and using QuantumEntanglementNetwork.

## Installation

To install QuantumEntanglementNetwork, you can use pip:

```bash
1. pip install QuantumEntanglementNetwork
```

# Configuration

Before you can use QuantumEntanglementNetwork, you need to configure it. You can do this by creating a configuration file called quantumentanglementnetwork.cfg in the root directory of your project.

Here is an example configuration file:

```ini
1. [quantumentanglementnetwork]
2. backend = qiskit
3. num_qubits = 2
```

This configuration file tells QuantumEntanglementNetwork to use the Qiskit backend and to use 2 qubits.

# Using QuantumEntanglementNetwork

To use QuantumEntanglementNetwork, you need to import it in your Python script:

```python
1. from QuantumEntanglementNetwork import QuantumEntanglementNetwork
```

You can then create a QuantumEntanglementNetwork object:

```python
1. quantum_entanglement_network = QuantumEntanglementNetwork()
```

You can use the generate_entanglement method to generate entanglement:

```python
1. quantum_entanglement_network.generate_entanglement()
```

You can use themeasure_entanglement method to measure entanglement:

```python
1. measurement = quantum_entanglement_network.measure_entanglement()
```

# Conclusion

QuantumEntanglementNetwork is a powerful tool for working with quantum entanglement networks. With its simple and intuitive API, you can easily generate and measure entanglement in your Python scripts.
